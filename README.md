# üåü Announcing the Release of "Art of Stratagem" üåü

We are excited to announce the release of "Art of Stratagem," an advanced algorithmic trading system designed for a select group of 100 users. Each week, 10 new participants will be carefully chosen, allowing us to ensure seamless integration and provide personalized guidance. From the first week, the algorithm will scan between 45 and 60 symbols, analyzing 300 million data points per pair every second to deliver highly accurate trading signals directly through a bot.

This system is not a commercial product, and there is no profit motive behind it. We are committed to fostering a community of trust and collaboration. Any misuse, such as sharing signals, will result in immediate termination of access to the algorithm.

Applicants must meet basic entry requirements, but those with expertise in programming languages such as C or Rust, as well as individuals skilled in mathematics‚Äîencompassing calculus, statistics, probability, discrete mathematics, Fourier analysis, and chaos theory‚Äîwill be prioritized. These individuals will have the opportunity to work closely with our core team to enhance the algorithm and drive further innovation.

## üìù Basic Requirements for Participation:

- üíµ Entry Fee: A one-time entry fee of $599 is required. This fee covers a fraction of the server costs and facilitates the setup of our infrastructure.
  
- üåê Monthly Colocation Fee: An ongoing monthly fee of $99 will be charged for server colocation. Each server is estimated to peak at 0.75 kW per hour. The total cost for a full rack colocation is approximately $3,000, with an additional charge of $0.125 per kVA, amounting to around $100. These costs will be shared equally among all users and may be subject to minor adjustments until the actual bill is received.
  
- üí∞ Minimum Trading Capital: Participants must have a minimum trading capital of $15,000. This requirement is in place as I do not promote leveraging; instead, I advocate for slow, stable returns with minimal risk.

- üìä Personalized Signal Generation: The signals generated by the algorithm will vary for each user, depending on your input regarding trading frequency, responsiveness to time-sensitive signals, and your risk tolerance. This customization is essential for the algorithm to recommend the optimal position size for every trade.

- üîí Fund Segregation: It is crucial that participants keep their trading funds separate from personal funds to mitigate emotional decision-making related to personal trades.

- ‚öñÔ∏è Position Sizing: Our approach to position sizing recognizes that not all trades are equal; each trade carries its own unique risk and reward profile. I am dedicated to implementing a nuanced strategy that accounts for these differences, ensuring that position sizes are optimized according to the specific characteristics of each opportunity. This tailored approach is critical to maximizing profitability and effectively managing risk.

By adhering to these requirements, participants will be well-positioned to make the most of this unique trading opportunity.

## üìú Rules and Guidelines:

- ü§ê Confidentiality: Users must not leak or share any signals received from the algorithm. Any violation of this rule will result in immediate termination of access to the signals.

- üîÑ Renewals: Users are required to renew their access promptly before each calendar date. Failure to do so will be considered a withdrawal, resulting in the loss of access to the signals and placement at the end of the queue. We advise you to thoroughly evaluate your decision to apply, as participation in this initiative necessitates a significant long-term commitment.

- üìà Market Dynamics: Given the dynamic nature of the market, there will not be fixed entry prices or take-profit levels. All calculations are conducted in real time by the algorithm. Therefore, individuals who are unable to respond quickly to alerts should refrain from applying.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: How will participants be selected for the trading system?**  
A: Participants will be selected based on a combination of their expertise and the application date. We prioritize individuals with relevant programming or mathematical skills, as this helps foster a knowledgeable community that can contribute to the algorithm's development.

**Q: Can I apply if I have limited experience in algorithmic trading?**  
A: Yes, we welcome applicants with varying levels of experience. While having expertise in programming or mathematics is advantageous, we also value individuals eager to learn and contribute to our community. A commitment to understanding the algorithm and its signals is essential.

**Q: What potential returns can I anticipate?**  
A: I encourage you to approach this opportunity with a realistic mindset. While the algorithm has been combat-tested and has the potential to generate profits, I want to be clear: do not expect guaranteed returns. It is essential to view any investment as a long-term commitment, with the possibility of receiving little to no profit‚Äîor even incurring a loss of your initial capital. 

My primary focus is on covering server costs and assembling a dedicated team committed to innovation and excellence. If you are seeking high returns, I recommend exploring other avenues, such as MLM programs or trading gurus who may promise substantial profits. However, I advise caution when evaluating such claims.

By choosing to engage with this algorithm, you are participating in a thoughtful investment strategy rather than chasing unrealistic gains. You will be joining a community centered on sustainable growth and collective advancement. I am committed to providing valuable insights and support throughout this journey. 

**Q: How often will I receive trading signals?**  
A: The frequency of signals will depend on market conditions and your specified trading preferences. The algorithm will analyze data in real time and provide signals based on your input regarding trading frequency and risk tolerance.

**Q: Are there any additional costs involved in participating?**  
A: In addition to the one-time entry fee and the monthly colocation fee, there are no hidden costs. However, should future advancements necessitate upgrades to our equipment for improved algorithm calculations, those costs will be distributed equally among all participants.

**Q: What support will be available to participants?**  
A: Participants will receive personalized guidance from our core team to help them understand the system and optimize their trading strategies. While we will provide valuable resources, community discussions will be invite-only, accessible to those who have made significant contributions to the core team. This approach ensures that we maintain a focused environment and understand each participant's involvement before engaging in broader discussions.

**Q: What happens if I need to withdraw from my participation?**  
A: If you decide to withdraw, please notify us in advance. While you may lose access to the signals, you will not be refunded the entry or monthly fees. Your involvement in this initiative requires a long-term commitment, so we encourage careful consideration before applying.
